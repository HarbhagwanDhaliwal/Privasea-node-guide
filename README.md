## 🔧 **Step 1: Run the One-Click Script**  
The entire setup process is streamlined into one simple command. Copy and paste the following into your terminal:  

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarbhagwanDhaliwal/Privasea-node-guide/refs/heads/main/Privasea.sh && chmod +x Privasea.sh && ./Privasea.sh
```  

📥 **What the command does**:  
- Downloads the setup script.  
- Makes the script executable.  
- Runs the setup process.  

🖥️ **What to Do**:  
- Follow the on-screen instructions carefully.  
- When prompted, create a **keystore password** (important for securing your node).  

---

## 📝 **Step 2: Record Your Node Address**  
- During the setup, a **keystore file** will be created, and your **node address** will be displayed.  
- **💡 Important:** Write down or copy this node address. You'll need it for the next step.  

### 🔗 **Register Your Node**:  
1. Open the Privasea Node Dashboard: [🌐 Privasea Dashboard](https://deepsea-beta.privasea.ai/createNode).  
2. Paste your **node address** and complete the registration process.  

🎯 Once done, return to the terminal to proceed.  

---

## ▶️ **Step 3: Start Your Node**  
- When asked, `Do you want to proceed with running the node? (y/n):`, type **`y`** and press Enter.  
- Enter the **keystore password** you created earlier when prompted.  

✅ If successful, your node will start and go live!

## 💰 **Step 4: Stake TPRAI Tokens**  
After your node is live, it’s time to stake TPRAI tokens. Here's how:  

1. **🔍 Verify Node Status**:  
   - Visit the [Privasea Dashboard](https://deepsea-beta.privasea.ai) and confirm your node is **online**.  

2. **💸 Get Free TPRAI Tokens**:  
   - Go to the [TPRAI Faucet](https://deepsea-beta.privasea.ai/deepSeaFaucet).  
   - Claim your free tokens to start staking.  

3. **📊 Stake Tokens**:  
   - On the dashboard, go to **Node Details**.  
   - Stake the TPRAI tokens in your node to complete the process.  

---

## 🔐 **Step 5: Save Your Keystore File**  
At the end of the setup, you’ll see the **path to your keystore file** (e.g., `$HOME/privasea/config/wallet_keystore`).  

🔒 **Why is this important?**  
- This file contains your wallet credentials.  
- Keep it safe! You’ll need it to **claim airdrops** and manage your node in the future.  

---

## 🚨 **Key Reminders**  
- 🌟 Ensure your node remains **online** to maximize rewards.  
- 🔑 Secure your keystore file and password; losing them could lead to access issues.  
- 🛠️ For help, check the [Privasea Community](https://deepsea-beta.privasea.ai) or documentation.
