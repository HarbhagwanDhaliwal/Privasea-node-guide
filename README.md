# **🌊 Privanetix Node Setup Guide 🚀**

## **Overview**
Welcome to the **Privanetix Node Setup Guide**! This guide will help you quickly set up your node using Docker, so you can start contributing to the network. Let’s dive in! 💻

## **Prerequisites** 🛠️
Before starting, make sure **Docker** is installed on your machine. To check, run:
```bash
docker --version
```
If you don’t have Docker yet, [follow this guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install it.

---

## **Step 1: Pull the Docker Image 📥**
Start by pulling the latest `privanetix/acceleration-node-beta` image from Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull privasea/acceleration-node-beta:latest
```
This will get you the latest and greatest version of the image for your node. 🔥

---

## **Step 2: Generate the Keystore File 🔐**
Run this command to generate a brand-new keystore file:
```bash
docker run -it -v "/privasea/config:/app/config" privasea/acceleration-node-beta:latest /app/node-calc new_keystore
```
The keystore file is essential for your node’s secure authentication. 🛡️

---

## **Step 3: Check for the Keystore File & Rename It 🔍**
Navigate to the config folder to find your newly generated keystore:
```bash
cd /privasea/config && ls
```
You should see a file like:
```
UTC--2025-01-06T06-11-07.485797065Z--f07c3ef23ae7beb8cd8ba5ff546e35fd4b332b34
```

Rename it to `wallet_keystore` for easier access:
```bash
mv ./UTC--2025-01-06T06..xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ./wallet_keystore
```

---

## **Step 4: Create Your Node & Add the Keystore Address 🧑‍💻**
Before running the node, you need to create it using the address from your keystore. 

Head over to this link to create your node and add the generated address:
[✨ Create Node & Add Address ✨](https://deepsea-beta.privasea.aiprivanetixnode/)

---

## **Step 5: Run the Node 🚀**
Now, let’s get your node running! Use the following command and replace `123456` with your own password (for security):
```bash
docker run -d -v "/privasea/config:/app/config" \
-e KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=123456 \
privasea/acceleration-node-beta:latest
```
Your node will start running in the background. 🏃‍♂️💨

---

## **Step 6: Verify the Node is Running ✅**
To make sure everything’s running smoothly, check with:
```bash
docker ps
```
If you see the container listed, your node is up and running successfully! 🎉

---

## **Troubleshooting 🛠️**
- If the node doesn't start, double-check the volume path (`/privasea/config`) and ensure the password is correctly set.
- Make sure Docker is properly installed and running on your machine.
- For error logs, use:
  ```bash
  docker logs <container_id>
  ```

---

That’s it! You’ve successfully set up your **Privanetix node** and are ready to contribute to the network. 🌐🎉 Happy running!
